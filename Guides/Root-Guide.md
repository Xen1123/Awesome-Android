<h2 align=center>The Finale</h2>

- It Is Now Time To Unlock Your Bootloader, Please Make Sure You Enabled OEM Unlocking Earlier
- Reboot Into Your Bootloader Interface And Proceed With The Unlock, Confirming On Your Device With Volume Buttons & Power Key

```bash
adb reboot bootloader && fastboot flashing unlock
```
- If This Did Not Activate The Prompt But OEM Unlocking Is Enabled And You're In Fastboot, Try This

```bash
fastboot flashing oem unlock
```

- If This Failed, Stop Here, You May Be Missing Fastboot Drivers, Does Your Device Show Up When You Type `fastboot devices`?

```bash
fastboot flash init_boot root_init_boot.img && fastboot reboot

  - Play Integrity
    - When you unlock an Android bootloader, root the device, or flash a custom ROM, your device is considered "bad" to Google's servers. Apps that rely on Play Integrity will fail to work (signing in may not work or the app will just not open), this is device dependent, Google Pixels are typically very good at Play Integrity, even with unlocked, modded devices. Although Pixels are typically safe, other phones tend to have broken integrity just from unlocking the bootloader - Magisk modules do exist to help you, though, but on select devices, you'll need to flash all of these.
